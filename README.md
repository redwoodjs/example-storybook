## Excerpts from The Storybook Introduction

> Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

> Use Storybook to build small atomic components and complex pages in your web application. If it's a UI, you can build it with Storybook.

...

> Storybook is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.


> Stories are a pragmatic, reproducible way to keep track of UI edge cases. Write stories once then reuse them to power automated tests.

> Document UI for your team to reuse

> Storybook brings together UI, examples, and documentation in one place. That helps teammates adopt existing UI patterns.
