## Getting Started
### System Requirements

> RedwoodJS requires Node.js (>=14.x <=16.x) and Yarn (>=1.15).

### Developer Experience 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/redwoodjs/example-storybook.git `# clone the repository from GitHub` \
  && cd "$(basename "$_" .git)" `# change directories into the newly cloned repository` \
